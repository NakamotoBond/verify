We allow anonymous crypto teams to build trust with their communities without making their identities public.
# Crypto KYC - Trust As A Service
Nakamoto Bond was created as a compliance tool to protect IDO and ICO participants from scam and Rugpulls.

We store KYC data privately on behalf of Crypto project founders and only make it public when they go against their community guidelines or break ethical and legal processes in their conduct. 

# Launch Successful IDO
Getting Verified by Nakamoto will enable investors to have confidence in your project.
